# TSID Rust

A Rust library for generating TSID (Time-Sorted Unique Identifier) - a distributed unique ID generation system inspired by Twitter's Snowflake.

## Features (Planned)

- 64-bit integer IDs
- 42-bit timestamp component (millisecond precision)
- Monotonically increasing within the same millisecond
- Thread-safe and lock-free
- Zero external dependencies
- Optimized for performance
